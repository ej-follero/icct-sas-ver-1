## Best Practices

### üéØ **Efficient Workflow**
1. **Filter First**: Use year level and status filters to narrow down students
2. **Search Specific**: Use search for specific students by name or ID
3. **Check Capacity**: Verify section capacity before selecting many students
4. **Review Selection**: Always review selected students before assignment

### üìä **Capacity Management**
1. **Monitor Enrollment**: Keep track of section enrollment levels
2. **Plan Assignments**: Consider capacity when planning bulk assignments
3. **Use Filters**: Filter by year level to ensure compatibility
4. **Batch Processing**: For large assignments, consider multiple smaller batches

### üîí **Security Considerations**
1. **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized users can assign students
2. **Audit Trail**: All assignments are logged with timestamps
3. **Validation**: Multiple validation layers prevent invalid assignments
4. **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No students found"
- **Cause**: Search filters too restrictive
- **Solution**: Clear search terms and filters, try broader search

#### "Section capacity exceeded"
- **Cause**: Trying to assign too many students
- **Solution**: Reduce number of selected students or choose different section

#### "Students already enrolled"
- **Cause**: Students already assigned to the section
- **Solution**: Remove already enrolled students from selection

#### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Insufficient user permissions
- **Solution**: Contact administrator for proper role assignment

### Performance Tips
1. **Use Filters**: Apply filters to reduce the number of students loaded
2. **Batch Size**: For very large assignments, consider smaller batches
3. **Search Efficiently**: Use specific search terms to find students quickly
4. **Clear Selection**: Clear previous selections when starting new assignments
