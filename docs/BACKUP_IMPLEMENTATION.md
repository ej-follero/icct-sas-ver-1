# Backup System Implementation

## Overview
The backup system has been implemented with real functionality that performs actual data backup operations.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **Real Database Export**: Uses `pg_dump` to export PostgreSQL database
- **File System Backup**: Scans and compresses important project files
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during backup process
- **Compression**: Uses archiver library for efficient file compression
- **Background Processing**: Backups run in background without blocking UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

#### Backup Process
1. **Database Export** (30% of progress)
   - Exports PostgreSQL database using `pg_dump`
   - Creates SQL dump file
   - Updates progress to 30%

2. **File System Scan** (10% of progress)
   - Scans important directories: `src`, `public`, `prisma`, etc.
   - Excludes large directories: `node_modules`, `.git`, `backups`
   - Updates progress to 40%

3. **File Compression** (50% of progress)
   - Compresses all files using ZIP format
   - Real-time progress updates during compression
   - Updates progress from 40% to 90%

4. **Final Archive Creation** (10% of progress)
   - Creates final backup archive containing:
     - `database.sql` - Database dump
     - `files.zip` - Compressed project files
     - `metadata.json` - Backup metadata
   - Updates progress to 100%

#### File Structure
```
backups/
â”œâ”€â”€ {backupId}_{timestamp}.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ {backupId}_{timestamp}_database.sql (temp)
â””â”€â”€ {backupId}_{timestamp}_files.zip (temp)
```

#### Dependencies
- `archiver`: File compression
- `child_process`: Database export
- `fs/promises`: File system operations

## Usage

### Creating a Backup
```typescript
const backup = await backupService.createBackup({
  name: "My Backup",
  description: "Important backup",
  type: "FULL",
  location: "LOCAL",
  createdBy: userId
});
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
backupService.onBackupProgress(backupId, (progress) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.percentage}%`);
  console.log(`Task: ${progress.currentTask}`);
  console.log(`Files: ${progress.filesProcessed}/${progress.totalFiles}`);
});
```

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database
BACKUP_DIR=./backups  # Optional, defaults to ./backups
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/backup
Creates a new backup and starts the backup process.

### PUT /api/backup/[id]
Updates backup status, size, and file path.

### GET /api/backup
Retrieves all backups.

### DELETE /api/backup/[id]
Deletes a backup and its associated files.

## Database Schema

### SystemBackup Model
```prisma
model SystemBackup {
  id            Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  name          String
  description   String?
  type          BackupType
  size          String
  status        BackupStatus  @default(IN_PROGRESS)
  location      BackupLocation
  isEncrypted   Boolean       @default(true)
  retentionDays Int           @default(30)
  filePath      String?       // Path to actual backup file
  checksum      String?
  createdBy     Int
  createdAt     DateTime      @default(now())
  completedAt   DateTime?
  errorMessage  String?
  
  createdByUser User          @relation(fields: [createdBy], references: [userId])
  restorePoints RestorePoint[]
  backupLogs    BackupLog[]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Export Fails**

   - Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Verify database permissions

2. **File Compression Fails**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify file permissions
   - Ensure archiver package is installed

3. **Progress Not Updating**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify WebSocket connections
   - Check network connectivity
